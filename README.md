## Task 5.2

Clone the whole repository or just the [JupyterNotebook](Task5/task5.2.ipynb).
If you haven't used JupyterNotebook before, make sure to install all necessary packages and extensions for your IDE.
JupyterNotebook runs best inside a virtual environment on PyCharm (according to my experience).
When everything is installed, simply click on "Run all" (looks like two play buttons) and the code should be executed.


## Task 3.2

### Further information

Since we are only interested in the first 3 movements (afterwards it will always repeat the previous two steps - i.e. left, left ; left, right ; right, right) the number of steps is set to only 8. You are free to change this.

We set the initial start of the robot to be random as well - seemed feasible to us.
